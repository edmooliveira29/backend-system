## Backend Repository Installation

This guide describes how to install and run the backend repository, which uses MongoDB v6.0.5, as well as how to set up access to GitHub with two-factor authentication (2FA).

### Prerequisites

- A linux-based operating system, such as Ubuntu.
- Git installed on your machine.
- A GitHub account with 2FA enabled.

### Using NVM

To install NVM, open the terminal and run the following command:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

To install a version of Node.js using NVM, run the following command:

```sh
nvm install v18.16.0
```

To set the default Node.js version to be used, run the following command:

```sh
nvm alias default v18.16.0
```

For example, to set Node.js v16.0.0 as the default, run:

```sh
nvm alias default 16.0.0
```

### Setting Up 2FA Access to GitHub

GitHub offers various forms of authentication, and we recommend using a personal access token (PAT) that can be created on the security settings page of your GitHub account.

To create a PAT, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the security settings page of your GitHub account (https://github.com/settings/security).

2. Click "Personal access tokens".

3. Click "Generate new token".

4. Enter a description for the token (e.g. "Repository access to GitHub").

5. Select the permissions the token should have (e.g. read and write access to private repositories).

6. Click "Generate token".

7. Copy the generated token to a safe location. You will only see the token once, so be sure to copy it immediately.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, open the terminal and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://{YOUR ACCESS KEY}@github.com/edmooliveira29/backend-system.git
```

### Installing Dependencies

To install the project dependencies, run the following command in the project root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### Running the Repository

To run the repository, run the following command in the project root directory:

```sh
npm start
```

### Running the Tests

```
